📊 Project Overview

In this project, we simulate a real-world scenario where a data analyst is tasked by a bank manager to analyze customer data and uncover key insights. The analysis focuses on:

Client demographics and financial behaviors

Identifying high-value clients and cross-sell opportunities

Providing actionable insights for strategic banking decisions


The insights will help the bank:

📌 Key Business Questions Answered

Here are the business-driven questions addressed in this project:

🏆 High-Value Clients & Wealth Distribution

 How is the client distribution across different gender, age groups, and occupations?

 Can you identify which risk profiles (Risk Weighting) are associated with the highest exposure to loans, and how this impacts the bank’s overall loan portfolio?

 Which occupations hold the highest average bank deposits? Are there any occupations that consistently hold significant amounts of deposits?

 What is the relationship between the number of credit cards a client holds and their average bank deposits? Are clients with more credit cards also higher depositors?

 Do clients with higher estimated income tend to have higher loan amounts?

 Are clients with high superannuation savings also maintaining significant bank deposits?

🔐 Risk & Exposure Management

 What is the credit card usage behavior across different age groups? Do younger clients hold higher credit card balances?
 
 Which bank branches (BRId) are performing the best in terms of total loan amounts and total deposits?
 
 Who are the clients with credit cards but have not taken any loans?

👥 Demographic & Behavioral Analysis

 Who are the clients with high bank deposits but low credit card balances? What does this tell us about their financial habits?

 Who are the clients with the highest superannuation savings but also significant bank loans?

 How does the wealth distribution (bank deposits, savings, business lending) vary across different loyalty classifications (e.g., Jade, Platinum)?

💳 Product Utilization & Cross-Selling

 Who are the top clients by credit card balance and bank deposits combined?

 Identify clients with the highest number of properties who are also using multiple bank products (credit cards, loans, deposits).
